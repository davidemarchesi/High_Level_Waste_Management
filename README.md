# High Level Waste Management
## Energy (Nuclear) Engineering Bachelor Graduation Thesis

This repository will host the study made with my collegue Matteo for our Bachelor Thesis Project about the **High Level Waste Management**.
The work can be divided into three main parts:

### Waste Characterization
In this part is made a preliminary study of the conformation and composition of the various *radioactive wastes* which can be produced, and for this, that have
to be managed. Is made a characterization of the radionuclides in the different types of waste (*Industrial, medical, research, spent nuclear fuel,...*)
and their evolution during the time (how the activity changes).

### Shielding and Dose Assessment
Numerical and modellistic study of the different types of materials and designs needed to shield the radiations from the internal wastes in order to respect
the law-imposed limits of values of dose from the *radioprotectional* point of view.

### Experimental Spectrometry Approach
If the time and the university will allow us, it's possible to do an experimental characterization of a simplified model of High Level Waste canister (a
barrell with a radioactive source inside) with high resolution **Gamma Spectroscopy**.
