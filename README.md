# 'HLW - Preliminary study on the ceramic matrices disposal solutions: NZP for Cs137 and Murataite for Np237'
## Energy (Nuclear) Engineering Bachelor Graduation Thesis (W.I.P.)

This repository will host the study made with my collegues for our Bachelor Thesis Project about the **High Level Waste Management**.
The work can be divided into three main parts:

### Waste Characterization
In this part is made a preliminary study of the conformation and composition of the various *radioactive wastes* which can be produced, and for this, that have
to be managed. Is made a characterization of the radionuclides in the different types of waste (*Industrial, medical, research, spent nuclear fuel,...*)
to catalogue and analyse the ones for which are needed long term disposal facilities.

### Shielding and Dose Assessment
Numerical and modellistic study, with Cern's FLUKA software for Montecarlo simulations, of different types of materials and designs needed to shield radiations from the internal wastes in order to respect
the law-imposed limits of values of dose from the *radiation protection* point of view. Focus on the new Ceramic Waste concepts, in particular over two types of matrices : Sodium-Zirconium (for Cs137 and Sr90 disposal), Murataite (for Transuranic elements disposal, in our case is taken in consideration Np237).

### Radiation Damage brief analysis (DPA)
We also deepened, in our work, the field of the radiation damage and the related theories. Dealing with the ceramic matrices, and radioactive waste, listed above, we did some simulations to see the effect of the two different types of decay considerated (alpha and gamma) on the materials, making some practical consideration about them.

### Conclusions
Considerations about the simulations, from the physical, radiation protection, and managerial point of view. Pro and Cons of the partitioning process and of the use of Ceramic Waste matrices for the HLW disposal.
